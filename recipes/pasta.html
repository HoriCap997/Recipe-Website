        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta</li>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large head green cabbage, shredded</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pound smoked sausage, sliced</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li> 
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the bow tie pasta and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the garlic, olive oil, and cabbage; season with salt and pepper; cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in the sausage and bow tie pasta; cook until completely heated, about 5 minutes more. Top with Parmesan cheese and serve immediately.</li>
